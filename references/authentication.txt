## Overview
The authentication system manages user registration, login, password recovery, and session management. It should be secure, user-friendly, and integrate with the overall platform design.

## Objectives
- Provide secure user authentication
- Create smooth registration and login flows
- Implement password recovery functionality
- Maintain user sessions appropriately
- Protect routes based on authentication status

## Design Guidelines
- Clean, focused forms with minimal distractions
- Clear error messaging and validation feedback
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Consistent styling with the overall platform

## Component Structure
1. **Registration Form**
   - Email input
   - Password input with strength indicator
   - Confirm password
   - Terms and conditions acceptance
   - Submit button

   - Success confirmation

4. **Authentication Guards**
   - Protected route components
   - Redirect logic for unauthenticated users
   - Loading states during authentication checks

## Implementation Status
- Planning phase
- Not yet implemented

## Next Steps
1. Design authentication forms
2. Implement registration form with validation
3. Create login functionality
4. Add password recovery flow
5. Set up route protection
6. Implement session management

## Technical Notes
- Use JWT or similar token-based authentication
- Store tokens securely (HTTP-only cookies)
- Implement CSRF protection
- Consider 2FA for future enhancement
- Log authentication events for security monitoring
