# Exchange API Reference

## Overview
The exchange API connection system manages the integration between the trading bot platform and various cryptocurrency exchanges. It handles API key management, connection status, trading permissions, and secure storage of credentials.

## Objectives
- Enable secure connection to multiple exchanges
- Provide clear API key management interface
- Monitor and display connection status
- Manage trading permissions
- Ensure secure storage of API credentials

## Design Guidelines
- Clear, step-by-step connection process
- Strong visual indicators for connection status
- Explicit permission requirements
- Secure input fields for API credentials
- Consistent design with platform aesthetics

## Component Structure
1. **Exchange Selection**
   - List of supported exchanges
   - Exchange logos and names
   - Filter or search functionality
   - Connection status indicators

2. **API Key Management**
   - Input fields for API key and secret
   - Optional additional fields (passphrase, etc.)
   - Clear instructions for obtaining API keys
   - Secure input handling

3. **Permission Configuration**
   - Checklist of required permissions
   - Explanation of each permission
   - Visual guidance for exchange-specific settings
   - Validation of granted permissions

4. **Connection Testing**
   - Test connection button
   - Status indicator during testing
   - Clear success/failure messaging
   - Troubleshooting guidance for failures

5. **Exchange Dashboard**
   - Overview of connected exchanges
   - Connection status monitoring
   - Quick actions (test, edit, remove)
   - Last successful connection timestamp

6. **API Key Security**
   - Encryption status indicators
   - Key permission warnings
   - Security recommendations
   - IP restriction settings (if applicable)

## Implementation Status
- Planning phase
- Not yet implemented

## Next Steps
1. Research API requirements for target exchanges
2. Design exchange selection interface
3. Create API key input form
4. Implement connection testing functionality
5. Develop permission validation system
6. Build exchange dashboard

## Technical Notes
- Never store API secrets in plain text
- Use server-side encryption for credentials
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Consider rate limiting for API requests
- Ensure proper validation of API responses
- Use WebSockets for connection status when available
