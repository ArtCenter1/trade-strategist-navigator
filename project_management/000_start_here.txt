## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**: 
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Follow the existing folder structure

2. **Styling**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Follow the design system defined in tailwind.config.ts

3. **State Management**:
   - Use React Query for server state
   - Use React Context for global UI state
   - Use React useState/useReducer for local component state

4. **Project Management**:
   - Always update the `current_phase.txt` file at the end of your session
   - Check the current phase checklist to identify tasks
   - When completing a feature, update the corresponding reference file

## Continuity Between Sessions

To maintain continuity between development sessions:

1. Begin by reading `current_phase.txt` to understand the current state of the project
2. Check the current phase checklist to identify what needs to be done
3. Implement the required features or fixes
4. Update the relevant reference files with your progress
5. Update `current_phase.txt` with what you completed and what should be done next

## Current Focus

Please refer to `current_phase.txt` to see the current focus of development and what tasks need to be addressed next.
